# Cloud Functions

<TagLinks />


* is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests.
* events
  * did user log in for the first time, send them a welcome email
  * Did user enter a new value, update it into DB via function
  * did user update photo, manululate, resize, add filter all on Cloud
  * Cloud messaging, send messages to friends
* Each function runs in isolation, in its own environment with its own configuration.
* Auto-scaling default, no need to worry about holiday time
* Functions are written in either javascript or Typescript
  * TypeScript supports latest JavaScript features like async/await, simplifying promise management
* All typescript files are compiled to plain javascript and saved in `lib` directory

Webpack serves an important job. It bundles all the scattered Typescriptâ€™s modules/files and bundle them into a single index.js Javascript file. This is important because the Cloud Functions will only use that single file for deployment.
