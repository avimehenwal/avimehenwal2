  * Did user enter a new value, update it into DB via function
  * did user update photo, manululate, resize, add filter all on Cloud
  * Cloud messaging, send messages to friends
* Each function runs in isolation, in its own environment with its own configuration.

* Functions are written in either javascript or Typescript
  * TypeScript supports latest JavaScript features like async/await, simplifying promise management
* All typescript files are compiled to plain javascript and saved in `lib` directory
