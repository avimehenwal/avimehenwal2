* [mnemonic] systems
  * earning technique that aids information retention or retrieval (remembering) in the human memory.
  * Mnemonics make use of elaborative encoding, retrieval cues, and imagery as specific tools to encode any given information in a way that allows for efficient storage and retrieval. Mnemonics aid original information in becoming associated with something more accessible or meaningfulâ€”which, in turn, provides better retention of the information.
