> Pay Attention, because its a **FINITE** resource

- Attention is a process of selection, enhancing one thing and supressing the other.
- Things we ignore are essentially which do not exist for us. Thats a BIG one
- LSD Drugs remove attentional filters and they are flooded with stimuli
- 2 types of Attentions, as per evolution
  - Involuntary, attention to speaker, siren, predator calls, flashing lights, smell of smoke
  - Voluntary - top down, what do you want to focus on? Jealous thought or peaceful thought
- We naturally pay more attention to negative emotions like fear and sadness, because they cause pain, so that we will solve the associated problem.
  - If you are upset, your pain makes you make ammends.
  - If your are sick, Anxiety makes you call the doctor
  - If you are angered by Injustice, you protest.
  - They are good, problem solving

::: quote William James
my experience is what I **agree** to **attend** to
:::

- Problem when overused, he/she gets all the lucky breaks, I cannot do it, what if I fail!
- Research by [Barbara Fredrickson](https://peplab.web.unc.edu/) at university North Carolina, people in +ve emotional state see many more things than people in -ve/neutral state.
  - which one do you think is better? Multiple possibilities or a fixed single possibility?
  - Neuroplasticity, you change your brain through actions, karma
  - Meditating (prolonged focusing on something) on compassion/something, changes your mind
- Feel and function properly, being happy all the time.
- Develop the ability to **SHIFT** your attention **AT WILL**

::: tip Dalai Lama
Weather in practise or daily life, we try to pay attention to just being present.
Rather being caught between hope and fear, which is the minds usual condition.

There is a difference b/w passing the time and time well spent
:::

- Obama, guy living in a pressure cooker, still seems to be calm all the time. Working on 6 pressing issues
  - health care
  - economic crisis
- Anything becomes worth it, if you pay attention to it. You find ways to make it worth.
- You cannot always be happy, but you can try to be focused most of the times, thats what we can strive for.
- Ride bike and sing at the same time, using different circuits of the brain
  - Trouble reading a book and singing at the same time.
  - We are programmed to attend to voice

::: quote Rodney Brooks
We **over estimate** the technology in _short term_ and **under estimate** in _long term_

Definition of Spirituality

1. When I close my eyes, I am at peace
2. When I open them, my heart asks what can I do for you?

Opposite of Worldlyness

1. When I close my eyes, all types of tension and anxiety
2. When I open them, what can I get from you!

\*[RAPT]: completely fascinated or absorbed by what one is seeing or hearing.
