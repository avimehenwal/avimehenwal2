<TagLinks />

## Krishnmurthy

* Inquire about the complex problem of desire.
  * Social and biological needs
* Desire for amusement, money, to be successful, sex, excitement etc.
  * and demand for fulfillment
  * Religion says supress the desire!
  * We are not trying to encourage/supress it. Its a fact, its there, what do we do about it?

> Is beauty a sensation?

* Looking at the bautyful things arouses some sensations, its natural and healthy
* We then create an image out of that sensation
  * When thought makes an image of sesnsation, then desire is more
  * Sensation is NOT desire.

You look at beautyful painting, and admire its beauty. It becomes a desire when a thought creeps in
to have that painting in your room.

We need to find a way to maintain a gap between sensation and image.
Both sensation and thought are kind of natural, we can manupulate image with training

* Learning is discipline
* How to we keep a seperation b/w thought and sensation.
* Never be identified with any of this.

## God

> Thoughts ruling our thoughts

* Who has created god? Have we created god? or the god created us?

You are in a jungle and you have to walk alone, without anyones help.
For that you need vitality, vigor and strength
Not belief in god and goodness, belief has no place when truth is concerned.

* If you beleive in something what value does it adds to your life?
  * Dont you want to find the truth and investigate yourself?
* How To empty the contents of brain?
  * Tools offerend by religion?
* Memory has a place as knowledge,
  * Knowledge as image has no place in relationships between human beings
