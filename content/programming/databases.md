# Database

<TagLinks />

[Database] in itself is data-structure problem at scale. How do we organize, collect, store data
in a way such that we can use relationships / associations to query targeted data.

DBMS - [Database] management system
: is the **software** that interacts with end users, applications, and the [Database] itself to capture and analyze the data.

[Database] Model
: How data is <mark>stored, organized and manipulated</mark> internally by the DBMS.

![Database Relationships with UML](/diagrams/database_relationships.svg)

1. Hierarchical [Database]
2. Object Model - JavaScript in browser v8 engine
3. Document Model - page data on browser when a URL response is rendered
4. Relations [Database] Models - SQL and MySQL
5. Non-Relational [Database]s aka noSQL - MongoDB, Firebase

### SQL based Terminologies

todo add examples to each :exclaimation:

DCL - Data control language
: controls access to data;

DDL - Data definition language
: defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them;

DML - Data manipulation language
: performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;

DQL - Data query language
: allows searching for information and computing derived information.

Relationships
: are a logical connection between different tables, established on the basis of interaction among these tables.

Transactions
: ACID Transactions to support rollback in case of failures. ACID Transactions to build reliable and secure business critical applications.

SP - Stored procedures
: restrict access to DBMS only through SP

Associative table
: A relational database requires the implementation of a base relation (or base table) to resolve many-to-many relationships. A base relation representing this kind of entity is called, informally, an associative table.

Database normalization
: structure DBMS to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Database Features

* Replication
  * storage redundancy, to increase data availability and resilience in case of partial failure
* Security
* Transactions and concurrency
* Easy Migrations
* Easy Backup and Restores
* [Database] logs, Querying tools like FQL Facebook query language
* Scaling
  * Sharding
  * Multiple Master - Multiple Slave
  * Horizontal and vertical scaling techniques

## Database Normalization


## Database Relationships

Applicable to Relational DBMS, but concept extends to all other (no-SQL) DBMS as well.

A table relationship is established when a child table defines a **Foreign Key** column that references the **Primary Key** column of its parent table.

$Parent(PrimaryKey) \xrightarrow{Relationship} Child(ForeignKey)$

Every [Database] table relationship is, therefore, built on top of Foreign Key columns

<!-- Add Examples -->

#### one-to-many Relationship (1:M)

![one to many relationship 1:M](https://fmhelp.filemaker.com/help/18/fmp/en/FMP_Help/images/relational.07.04.2.png)

The One-to-Many relationship is defined as a relationship between two tables where a row from one table can have multiple matching rows in another table. This relationship can be created using Primary key-Foreign key relationship.
It is the most common relationship.

[Efficient way to join two tables with one to many relationship](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/118693/efficient-way-to-join-two-tables-with-one-to-many-relationship)


###### Examples,
* Customers and Orders tables.
* A book can have multiple authors.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.Book (
  Pk_Book_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(255),
  ISBN VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE dbo.Author (
  Pk_Author_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  FullName     VARCHAR(255),
  MobileNo     CHAR(10),
  Fk_Book_Id   INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Book(Pk_Book_Id)
);

-- ist of all users and their permissions.
SELECT * FROM Users
JOIN UserPermissions USING (UserLogin);
```

#### one-to-one Relationship (1:1)
requires the child table Primary Key to be associated via a Foreign Key with the parent table Primary Key column.
Multiple columns in the same table have 1:1 relationship. Coule also be implemented of other tables using a
Foreign Key Reference.


###### Examples,

* in a marriage, each spouse has only one other spouse. This kind of relationship can be implemented in a single table and therefore does not use a foreign key.

#### [many-to-many] Relationship (M:M)

![many to many datbase realtionship M:M](https://d186loudes4jlv.cloudfront.net/sql/images/table_relationships/many-to-many.png)

An associative entity is a term used in relational and entityâ€“relationship theory. A relational database requires the implementation of a base relation (or base table) to resolve [many-to-many] relationships. A base relation representing this kind of entity is called, informally, an associative table.

It requires a link table containing two Foreign Key columns that reference the two different parent tables. Generally a [many-to-many] relationship is done with a junction table, like so:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    employee_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE company (
    company_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_name VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE company_employee (
    employee_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    company_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    work_hour_start TIME NOT NULL,
    work_hour_end TIME NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employee (employee_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES company (company_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, company_id, work_hour_start, work_hour_end)
);

SELECT e.employee_name, c.company_name, ec.work_hour_start, ec.work_hour_end
FROM employee e
INNER JOIN company_employee ec
ON e.employee_id = ec.employee_id
INNER JOIN company c
ON c.company_id = ec.company_id;
```


###### Examples,

* relationship between the Orders and Products table. An order can contain multiple products, and a product could be linked to multiple orders: several customers might submit an order that contains some of the same products.
* Students and Courses
* Users and Permissions

## Relational DBMS

Almost 25 years old, mySQL Relational DBMS, written in C, C++, take it for a spin

```sh
docker pull mysql
# server
docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql
# client
docker exec -it some-mysql bash
```



## Considerations when designing a database schema

* Collect as much data as possible
  * you  may never know what you might need in future to scale, add new feature, analytics
* Group data logically together
  * based on readability
  * efficiency
  * usage
