# Data Structures

<TagLinks />

Why are they important? What is the point of data structure?

* Efficient processing of data by computer CPU
* Way of storing and organizing data in such a way that it can be proccessed efficiently

## Types

1. Linear data Structures
   1. can be traversed in singled run
   2. Examples
      1. Arrays
      2. Stacks
         1. LIFO
         2. FIFO
      3. Queues
2. Non Linear data structures
   1. cannot be traversed in single run
   2. Examples
      1. Trees
      2. Graphs
      3. Linked lists
         1. sequence of nodes
         2. DYnamic Data structures
         3. Grow and shrink at runtime

* What are Bibnary trees
* Binary Heaps
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
  * Divide and conquer
* Linear Sort
* Difference between stacks and Queues
* What are recursive algorithms
* Sorting algorithms
  * Merge Sort
* Heap vs Tree and Stack , Advantages and disaddvantages

## Trees

* Operations
  * Tree generations
  * Tree traversal
    * inorder
    * preorder
    * postorder
  * Tree searching
  * Tree modification
  * Node deletion
  * Balancing tree
* Heaps
  * max heap
  * min heap
  * Operations
    * insertion
    * self-balancing
    * removal - pop from the root
    * Sorting
    * Heapify
  * Priority Queue

Always analyze your solution, space time complexity

* Function to implement unival trees?
* How to implement auto-completion?
* K-th largest number
  * Brute force technique
  * Improve your solution

### Operations on trees

#### Traversal

* BFS Breadth first Search
* DFS Depth First Search

##  How to get a job at BIG 4

* Facebook
* Google
* Amazon
* Microsoft
* twitch
* Dropbox
* Airbnb

      6. Topcoder
   4. Mock Interviews

> Its simple, but **NOT EASY**

* Finding 2 strings of anagrams
* finding the intersection of 2 lists
* Fidning duplicates
* Hashtables and sorting solves most intial problesm
* Recursion problem
* Find all the words on a boggle board
  * Order 1, thats what everybody wants

If you start preparing after interview is schedules, you might already be too late

Do you have what it takes to get the job

* Apply, went in and tols that you are not good enough
