Data Structure
: A [data structure] is a format to
<mark>store, manage and organize</mark>
data in such a way that enables
efficient **data access** and **data modification**.

ADT abstract data type
: is a mathematical model for data types.

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of **applications**, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.

Choice of data- structure selection to attack a problem seperates pros from mediocre porgrammers

> ADT can themselves be implemented in a variety of ways

Abstraction ADT | Implementation DS
:--------------:|:-------------------:
List    | Dynamic Array<br> Linked list
Queue   | linked list<br> using Arrays<br> stack based
Map     | Tree map<br> Hash Map<br> Hash Table<br>
Vehicle   | Golf cart<br> Bicycle<br> Smart car

###### Some examples,

1. Relational **databases** commonly use *B-tree indexes* for data retrieval
1. while **compiler** implementations usually use *hash tables* to look up identifiers.


> Usually, efficient data structures are key to **designing efficient algorithms**.

Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointerâ€”a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program

## Data structure Types

There are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler primitive data types:

1. Linear data Structures
   1. can be traversed in singled run
   2. Examples
      1. Arrays
      2. Stacks
         1. LIFO
         2. FIFO
      3. Queues
2. Non Linear data structures
   1. cannot be traversed in single run
   2. Examples
      1. Trees
      2. Graphs
      3. Linked lists
         1. sequence of nodes
         2. Dynamic Data structures
         3. Grow and shrink at run-time

### Spanning Tree

* Operations
  * Tree generations
  * Tree traversal
    * in-order
    * preorder
    * post-order
  * Tree searching
  * Tree modification
  * Node deletion
  * Balancing tree
* Heaps
  * max heap
  * min heap
  * Operations
    * insertion
    * self-balancing
    * removal - pop from the root
    * Sorting
    * Heapify
  * Priority Queue
