## Standardization Organization

> overhead in running a standards organization

* [ISO] standards and technical documents are developed by volunteers.
* [ISO] does not pay for their services or even cover expenses. Yet when the work is finished even they are expected to buy a a copy of the final document from the organization that they volunteered to help.
*
Each standard has a committee;
each committee needs help with the bureaucracy,
every standard needs to be reviewed,
printed (in the days before PDF), shipped, and so forth. [ISO] itself needs buildings,
and all the costs associated with those.


* [ ] Will cheap documents serve your purpose?
* [ ] Will only documentation help achieving your aim?
* [ ] Does your organization wants to be on same page even after getting [ISO] certified?
* [ ] Do you think effective implementation will help your organization
