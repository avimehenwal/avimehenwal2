::: quote Ryan Jarvinen
May the source be with you

What if we can have version controlled slides written in HTML and CSS, with animation and all that we can
easily export to PDF format and host on our websites?


## Reveal.js and reveal-md

```
reveal-md slides.md --theme solarized
reveal-md slides.md --print slides.pdf
reveal-md slides.md --static _site

reveal-md slides.md --watch --featured-slide
```

* Host your slides on kubernetes, running in a container
* Have hot reload

## Sozi

* Inkscape + [Sozi](https://sozi.baierouge.fr/)
