## Power of git

`git rev-list` : list commits on reverse chronological order

Suppose you have to rebase some of your commits. When you change the commits, would the tests still pass?

Did I break any code when I rebased the source?

```bash
( set -e && git rev-list --reverse master~3..master \
  | while read rev; do echo git checkout $rev; \
  python runtests.py; done)
```

::: theorem Power Law Distribution
implies that small values are extremely common, whereas large values are extremely rare.

I want to know the count of references of classes and modules in codebase?

```bash
grep-ruby() { find app lib -name '*.rb' | xargs grep $* }
grep-ruby() -h '[[:space:]]*\(class\|module\)\b' |
  sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//' |
  cut -d ' ' -f 2
  while read class; do
    echo "`grep-ruby -l "\b$class\b" | wc -l` $class"
```

## Submodules

* Git repository with in another git repository
* Git commit history comes along with submodule repository

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule summary
git submodule status
```

```bash
$ git submodule add --name subOne -- git@github.com:avimehenwal/javascript.git docs/docs/posts

###### How to edit any commit message? or as a matter of fact rewrite entire git history

strategy is checkout to commit -> amend message -> then rebase back to HEAD

```
# abort on conflicts
git rebase ... || git rebase --abort

git rebase --interactive <commit hash you want to change>^
# then reword commit message

# First commit
git rebase --interactive --root

# Rebase last N commits
git rebase --interactive @~9

# checkout the root commit
git checkout <sha1-of-root>

# amend the commit
git commit --amend

# rebase all the other commits in master onto the amended root
git rebase --onto HEAD HEAD master
```
## Merging 2 repos into 1

> subtree-merge or submodules

* didnâ€™t need the ability to extract changes and ship them back anywhere because my old repositories would be retired
* fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
  * git pull --allow-unrelated-histories

```
# In new git repo
git remote add one <url>
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories one master
find ! -path "./.git*" -exec mv -v --target-directory=one_repo {} +
mv -v .gitignore one_repo/
```

How do I merge A into B, without losing history on any side?

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=rails git://github.com/rails/rails.git master
```

This will appear as a single commit where all files of Rails master branch are added into "rails" directory. However the commit's title contains a reference to the old history tree:

### Git merge

Used when you have ammended/rebases commits on one branch which were already there in master.
Performing merge normally will raise **merge conflicts**. To automatically force rewrite changes (rebased or ammended) from develop to master use this command below

```
git merge --progress --verbose --summary -X theirs develop
```

## :cherry_blossom: Cherrypicking

Useful when working on opensourced projects, you might want to keep personal changes in develop branch,
but only cherry-pick certain commits to master branch for raising PR with upstream.

```bash
git cherry-pick <commitId> -n
```

### Reset

* To rewind local changes
* Time travelling
* 3 trees in git
