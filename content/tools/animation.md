## How to make Animation?

* Keynote can export slides as `svg` and `movie` format
  * google slides can do it too with limited features
  * lots of built in effects
* Use animated `gifs`, `svg` art from internet, stock gifs
  * Use preanimated objects.
* Keynote to blend everything together.
* Story boarding
  * visual outline of your video

## Video Formats

> whereas the major video formats are all frame-based

* get frames and them join them together using `convert` into `gif`
* SVG animation in browser render at 60fps and screen recorder can do 30fps (most of them)
  * recording output might look sluggish
* Vector based video format = death of pixel

```shell
convert -delay 5 -loop 0 frame??.svg animated.gif
```
