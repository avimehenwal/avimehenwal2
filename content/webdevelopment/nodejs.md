What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?
:   Javascript script or ECMA Script is a programming language standard

    NodeJS is a runtime interpreter and environment written in `C++` which support ECMA Script

    ::: tip JS Engine
    Both google chrome and node js both uses v8 javascript engine.
    Nodejs runtime is written in `C++`

* [Blocking and Non blocking calls](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/)
  * How is non-blocking achieved? Implemented
  * Event Loops
* [Callback Pattern](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/control-flow/what-are-callbacks/)
  * Foundations of nodejs
* WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)

A function is passed as an argument. aka **call-after**. Could be synchronous or asynchronous

```js
function processData (callback) {
  fetchData(function (err, data) {
    if (err) {
      console.log("An error has occurred. Abort everything!");
      return callback(err);
    }
    data += 1;
    callback(data);
  });
}
```

::: tip What is IO
$$IO = Disk, Network \, operations$$

"I/O" refers primarily to interaction with the system's disk and network supported by
[libuv.](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)

libuv
:   libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.

What is v8 javascript engine?
:   V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and [WebAssembly] engine, written in C++.

    It is used in **Chrome** and in **Node.js**, among others.
    It implements [ECMAScript] and [WebAssembly], and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors.
    V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

[What the difference between nodejs and v8 engine?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42616120/what-is-the-relationship-between-node-js-and-v8)
:   v8 - only client side in browser

    nodejs allows you to run [ECMAScript] event at server-side, provices a runtime ecosystem for js independent of browser.

    * Ffeatures like package manager and debugger availble in node ecosystem

Python and nodejs share some similarities
:   Both are implemented in low level languages like `C` and `C++`

    * both provides runtimes and package managers, use RFCs for language development
    * Uses C API

* NodeJs project uses lots of python tooling as well
  * ix failing tests
  * Improve code coverage
* [Project contribution, todo](https://www.nodetodo.org/)
* [HTTP/2]
  * compressed headers
  * Server Push
