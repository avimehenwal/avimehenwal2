# Payment Gateway

<TagLinks />

::: quote
The first online transaction in 1984 by 72-year old woman named snowflake
:::

* Very big industry
* Mobile Commerce - $150 billion this year US alone
* Web needs a better answer for payments

## Google Pay

> Google Pay lets your customers pay with the press of a button â€” using payment methods saved to their Google Account.

* Online Conversions
* Google [Pay] API
* It's competition to paypal
* PayPal is different from Google [Pay] in a number of ways. PayPal for example takes care of **processing the payment**, whereas Google [Pay] helps your users utilize their previously **saved cards** to pay in your site, but the processing of the payment still  happens through a payment processor or gateway.
* A better way to pay using your existing cards
