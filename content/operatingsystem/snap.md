A snap package is like a sandboxed application that is packaged in such a way that:

You can be sure you're running exactly what the app developer intended, as all dependencies and assets are bundled into the snap application package
The snap application generally doesn't own your entire system, it runs in an application sandbox of sorts
Snaps are cross-platform and distributed independently from apt/deb packages, and as such are usually more up to date than those found in apt
