NEATO is a program that makes layouts of undirected graphs following the
filter model of DOT. Its layout heuristic creates virtual physical models and
runs an iterative solver to find low energy configurations. The intended applications are in telecommunication networks, computer programming and software engineering. Here is an example layout depicting an entity-relationship
database schema. It took 0.01 seconds of user time to generate on a garden
variety PC running Linux.
